# Urban Green Space Access and Mental Health Impact in Hampton Roads

**By Ayngaran Krishnamurthy and Roshni Gannoju**

## Introduction:
In 2024, **Hampton Roads** stands at a critical juncture. With growing urbanization, many residents find themselves increasingly isolated from the healing power of nature. Access to green spaces, like parks, is becoming more of a luxury rather than a fundamental right. Yet, research consistently affirms the vital link between **green spaces** and **mental health**. The absence of these spaces can result in higher levels of mental distress, especially in densely populated urban areas.

## Objective:
Our study explores the impact of **green space accessibility** on mental health, aiming to uncover how access to parks influences mental health outcomes, such as **depression** and **anxiety**. Research has consistently shown that individuals who live near parks experience better mental health, while those in areas with limited green spaces face increased mental distress. 

In particular, our study emphasizes the underexplored relationship between urban green spaces and mental health. By providing valuable insights for **urban planners** and **public health officials**, we aim to raise awareness about the necessity of integrating parks into urban development strategies, particularly in regions with low access to green spaces.

## Key Findings:
- **Current disparities** in green space access among residents of Hampton Roads.
- The significant role of **urban planning** in promoting mental health through green space integration.
- The **direct positive correlation** between green space proximity and reduced mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.
- **Practical recommendations** to improve access to green spaces for underserved communities.

## Conclusion:
This study underscores the importance of **urban green spaces** in fostering better mental health outcomes. Whether at home or in the workplace, access to natural elements like parks, greenery, and sunlight is essential for reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. 

**Hampton Roads** must prioritize the incorporation of green spaces into urban planning strategies to ensure that all communities have equal access to nature's benefits. Green spaces should be regarded as integral components of both **public health infrastructure** and **urban development plans**, creating a healthier and more resilient community for all.

## Recommendations:
1. **Urban Planning:** Integrate more parks and green spaces into urban design to improve mental well-being.
2. **Community Outreach:** Educate the public about the mental health benefits of green spaces and advocate for their accessibility.
3. **Policy Advocacy:** Lobby for policy changes to ensure equitable distribution of green spaces in urban and suburban areas.
